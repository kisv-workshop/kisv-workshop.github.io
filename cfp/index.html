<p>This workshop will bring together researchers and developers from the field of
operating systems, programming languages, security, computer architecture and
verification with the goal to accelerate changes in the kernel through a
combination of isolation, programming language safety, and formal verification.</p>
<p>The objectives of the workshop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the challenges and opportunities in using hardware support for
kernel isolation, safe programming languages like Rust, and automated
verification tools like Dafny within the kernel environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand advantages and limitatins of modern hardware isolation mechanisms,
such as ARM memory tagging extensions (MTE), ARM pointer authentication (PAC),
Intel memory protection keys (MPK), etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify potential directions for the next generation of hardware isolation
mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify performance and ergonomic limitations of safe programming languages
like Rust for development of kernel subsystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss opportunities and limitations of modern autmated verification tools
and their applicability for modeling and verifying kernel subsystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss the practical aspects of isolating kernel subsystems and developing
parts of the kernel in a safe program- ming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify security limitations of isolation and safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggested paper topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Low-overhead, fine-grained isolation techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static analysis and programming language techniques aimed at automation of
isolation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware support for hardware-based address space isoaltion and software
fault isolation (SFI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security and performance analysis of modern hardware isolation primitives and
safe programming languages</p>

<p>SOSP conference brings together kernel practitioners—people of diverse academic
and industrial background who are united by the goal to build better operating
system kernels. We believe that today as a community we lack a workshop that
focuses on the very core problems of kernel organization: isolation, safety,
security. We hope that a focused workshop can accelerate exchange of ideas in
the areas that arguably can result in better foundation for the systems we run
today: practical isolation, safety, and verification of the kernel.</p>
